Let’s build a student result management system for KASMS step by step, as if you’re a 13-year-old learning to code. We’ll use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, as you requested. I’ll explain everything clearly, starting with planning the system, then guiding you through building it. Let’s make it fun and understandable!

---

### Step 1: Planning the System
Before writing code, we need to understand what the system does and what we need to build it. Think of this like planning a game—you need to know the rules and pieces before you start playing.

#### What the System Needs to Do
Based on your description, here’s what the system should include:

1. **Users and Their Roles**:
   - **Students**:
     - Log in with credentials (e.g., student ID and password).
     - View their coursework (CATs and assignments).
     - View final grades, fee balance, and exam card.
     - Register for a semester by selecting units and see the fee amount to pay.
   - **Instructors**:
     - Log in with credentials.
     - View students they teach based on unit codes.
     - Enter marks for exams and coursework.
   - **Head of Department (HOD)**:
     - Log in and view students in their department, filtered by year of study.
     - See student details (e.g., grades, enrollment status).
   - **Finance Department**:
     - Log in and update fee balances for students.

2. **Features**:
   - **Login System**: Different dashboards for students, instructors, HOD, and finance based on user type.
   - **Student Dashboard**:
     - View coursework (CATs, assignments).
     - View final grades, fee balance, and exam card.
     - Register for units and see semester fees.
   - **Instructor Dashboard**:
     - List students by unit code.
     - Input and update marks for coursework and exams.
   - **HOD Dashboard**:
     - View students in the department by year.
     - Access student details (e.g., grades, units enrolled).
   - **Finance Dashboard**:
     - Update student fee balances.
   - **Database**: Store user info, grades, units, fees, and more.

3. **How It Will Work**:
   - Users log in via a web page with their username and password.
   - The system checks their role (student, instructor, HOD, finance) and shows the right dashboard.
   - Data (like grades, fees, and units) is stored in a MySQL database.
   - PHP handles the backend (connecting to the database, processing logins, saving marks, etc.).
   - HTML and CSS create the user interface (web pages).
   - JavaScript makes the pages interactive (e.g., showing/hiding forms, validating input).

#### What We Need to Build It
1. **Tools**:
   - **Text Editor**: To write code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++).
   - **Web Server**: To run PHP (e.g., XAMPP, which includes Apache and MySQL).
   - **Browser**: To test the website (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
   - **MySQL**: To store data (included in XAMPP).

2. **Database Structure** (Tables in MySQL):
   - **Users**: Store login info (ID, username, password, role: student/instructor/HOD/finance).
   - **Students**: Store student details (student ID, name, department, year of study).
   - **Units**: Store unit details (unit code, name, instructor).
   - **Enrollments**: Track which students are taking which units.
   - **Marks**: Store coursework and exam marks (student ID, unit code, CATs, assignments, final exam).
   - **Fees**: Store fee balances (student ID, amount owed, semester).
   - **Exam_Card**: Track if a student qualifies for an exam card (based on fees and grades).

3. **Web Pages**:
   - **Login Page**: For all users to log in.
   - **Student Dashboard**: View grades, fees, exam card, and register units.
   - **Instructor Dashboard**: View students and input marks.
   - **HOD Dashboard**: View students by year.
   - **Finance Dashboard**: Update fee balances.
   - **Logout Page**: End the session.

4. **Languages**:
   - **HTML**: Structure the web pages (forms, tables, buttons).
   - **CSS**: Style the pages to look nice.
   - **JavaScript**: Add interactivity (e.g., form validation).
   - **PHP**: Handle backend tasks (logins, database queries, updating data).
   - **MySQL**: Store and retrieve data.

#### How It Will Flow
1. A user visits the website and sees a login page.
2. They enter their username and password, and PHP checks the database to verify them.
3. Based on their role, they’re sent to their dashboard:
   - Students see their grades, fees, and unit registration.
   - Instructors see their students and can enter marks.
   - HOD sees students in their department.
   - Finance updates fee balances.
4. Data is pulled from or saved to the MySQL database using PHP.
5. The exam card is shown only if fees are cleared and grades meet requirements.

### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment
Let’s set up the tools you need to start coding.

1. **Install XAMPP**:
   - Download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/.
   - Install it on your computer (it includes Apache for PHP and MySQL for the database).
   - Start the Apache and MySQL modules in the XAMPP control panel.

2. **Create a Project Folder**:
   - Find the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs`).
   - Create a folder called `kamsms` inside `htdocs`.
   - This is where all your project files (HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.) will go.

3. **Test Your Setup**:
   - Create a file called `test.php` in `htdocs/kamsms`.
   - Add this code to check if PHP works:
```php
<?php
echo "Hello, KASMS! PHP is working!";
?>
```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/kamsms/test.php`. If you see “Hello, KASMS! PHP is working!”, your setup is ready.

4. **Set Up MySQL**:
   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
   - Click “New” to create a database called `kasms_db`.
   - We’ll create tables later.

### Step 3: Designing the Database
The database is like a digital filing cabinet that stores all the data. Let’s create the tables we need using MySQL.

1. **Go to phpMyAdmin**:
   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`, select the `kamsms_db` database, and click the “SQL” tab to run queries.

2. **Create Tables**:
   Let’s create the tables we listed earlier. Copy and paste this SQL code into the SQL tab and click “Go”:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('student', 'instructor', 'hod', 'finance') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    year_of_study INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE units (
    unit_code VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    unit_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    instructor_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(20),
    unit_code VARCHAR(20),
    semester VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (unit_code) REFERENCES units(unit_code)
);

CREATE TABLE marks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(20),
    unit_code VARCHAR(20),
    cat1 INT,
    cat2 INT,
    assignment INT,
    final_exam INT,
    final_grade VARCHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (unit_code) REFERENCES units(unit_code)
);

CREATE TABLE fees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(20),
    semester VARCHAR(20),
    amount_owed DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
);

CREATE TABLE exam_card (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id VARCHAR(20),
    semester VARCHAR(20),
    eligible BOOLEAN,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
);
```

3. **Explanation of Tables**:
   - **users**: Stores login info. Passwords should be hashed (we’ll do this in PHP).
   - **students**: Stores student details like ID, name, department, and year.
   - **units**: Stores unit codes, names, and the instructor teaching them.
   - **enrollments**: Tracks which students are enrolled in which units.
   - **marks**: Stores CATs, assignments, exam marks, and final grades.
   - **fees**: Tracks how much a student owes for a semester.
   - **exam_card**: Determines if a student can get an exam card (eligible if fees are low and grades are okay).

4. **Insert Sample Data**:
   Let’s add some test data to work with. Run this SQL in phpMyAdmin:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES
('student1', 'hashed_password', 'student'),
('instructor1', 'hashed_password', 'instructor'),
('hod1', 'hashed_password', 'hod'),
('finance1', 'hashed_password', 'finance');

INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, department, year_of_study) VALUES
('S001', 'John Doe', 'Computer Science', 2);

INSERT INTO units (unit_code, unit_name, instructor_id) VALUES
('CS101', 'Introduction to Programming', 2);

INSERT INTO enrollments (student_id, unit_code, semester) VALUES
('S001', 'CS101', '2025-S1');

INSERT INTO fees (student_id, semester, amount_owed) VALUES
('S001', '2025-S1', 5000.00);

INSERT INTO exam_card (student_id, semester, eligible) VALUES
('S001', '2025-S1', FALSE);
```

*Note*: We’ll hash passwords later in PHP for security. For now, use plain text for testing.

### Step 4: Building the Login Page
Let’s create the first web page: the login page. This is where all users (students, instructors, HOD, finance) will log in.

1. **Create the Login Page (HTML + CSS)**:
   Create a file called `index.php` in `htdocs/kamsms`. This will be the main page.

```php
<?php
session_start();
// Redirect to dashboard if already logged in
if (isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
    if ($_SESSION['role'] == 'student') header("Location: student_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($_SESSION['role'] == 'instructor') header("Location: instructor_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($_SESSION['role'] == 'hod') header("Location: hod_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($_SESSION['role'] == 'finance') header("Location: finance_dashboard.php");
}
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>KASMS Login</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        .login-container {
            background-color: white;
            padding: 20px;
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
        }
        .login-container h2 {
            text-align: center;
        }
        .login-container input {
            width: 100%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px 0;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            border-radius: 4px;
        }
        .login-container button {
            width: 100%;
            padding: 10px;
            background-color: #28a745;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 4px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        .login-container button:hover {
            background-color: #218838;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="login-container">
        <h2>KASMS Login</h2>
        <form action="login.php" method="POST">
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Create the Login Handler (PHP)**:
   Create a file called `login.php` in `htdocs/kamsms` to process the login form.

```php
<?php
session_start();
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "kamsms_db");
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

// For now, assume plain text password for simplicity
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

if (mysqli_num_rows($result) == 1) {
    $user = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
    $_SESSION['user_id'] = $user['id'];
    $_SESSION['role'] = $user['role'];
    if ($user['role'] == 'student') header("Location: student_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($user['role'] == 'instructor') header("Location: instructor_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($user['role'] == 'hod') header("Location: hod_dashboard.php");
    elseif ($user['role'] == 'finance') header("Location: finance_dashboard.php");
} else {
    echo "Invalid username or password!";
}
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

3. **Test the Login Page**:
   - Open `http://localhost/kamsms/index.php` in your browser.
   - Try logging in with `username: student1` and `password: hashed_password`. It won’t work yet because we haven’t created the dashboard pages, but you should see the login form.

---

### Step 5: Next Steps
We’ve set up the environment, created the database, and built the login page. Here’s what we’ll do next:
1. **Create Dashboard Pages**:
   - Student dashboard: View grades, fees, exam card, and register units.
   - Instructor dashboard: View students and input marks.
   - HOD dashboard: View students by year.
   - Finance dashboard: Update fees.
2. **Secure Passwords**: Use PHP to hash passwords for security.
3. **Add JavaScript**: Validate forms and make pages interactive.
4. **Test Everything**: Make sure all features work.
